## Summary
By Creating this Simple basic website I did learn the basic concepts of HTML, CSS and also how to use Git and GitHub. While creating this application, I did really enjoy it. At first, I was little scared that will I be able to build a website from scratch and then I tried step by step and I made it. Moreover, everything went smoothly but I only had trouble creating the Navigation bar which took me the longer time.
